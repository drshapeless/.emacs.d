;;; init-typescript.el --- TypeScript support -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; I don't really like JavaScript, and TypeScript pretends that the
;; problem of JavaScript is because of missing a type system.

;;; Code:

(straight-use-package 'typescript-mode)
(require 'typescript-mode)

(provide 'init-typescript)
;;; init-typescript.el ends here
