;;; init-lsp.el ---  -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; An lsp client for Emacs.

;; I prefer eglot, but in lsp mode provides some fancy visual effect
;; on some modern language like flutter with dart.

;;; Code:

(leaf lsp-mode
  :require t)

(provide 'init-lsp)
;;; init-lsp.el ends here
